## Usage Instructions

### For Admin (Seeding Tracks)
1. Navigate to Admin Dashboard
2. Click "Music Pool" tab
3. Click "Seed R2 Data" button (purple/transparent button next to "Upload Track")
4. Confirm the action in the dialog
5. Wait for progress updates (displays batch progress)
6. Alert will confirm completion

### For Users (Browsing & Downloading)
1. Navigate to Music Pool page
2. Browse tracks by category, year, or genre
3. Click play icon to preview track (mini-player appears below)
4. Click "Download All" or individual version download buttons
5. Files download with proper naming: `Artist - Title (Version).mp3`

## Technical Details

### Firestore Structure
- **Collection**: `poolTracks`
- **Document ID**: Auto-generated by Firestore
- **Fields**: All fields from JSON (title, artist, genre, bpm, key, year, category, versions, previewUrl)

### Batch Upload Strategy
- **Batch Size**: 450 documents per batch
- **Total Batches**: ~88 batches for 39,387 tracks
- **Progress Updates**: After each batch commit
- **Error Handling**: Try-catch with user alerts

### Download Strategy
- **Method**: Fetch → Blob → Temporary Link → Auto-click → Cleanup
- **Naming**: `${artist} - ${title} (${version}).mp3`
- **CORS**: Handled by blob conversion

## Potential Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Firebase Write Limits
- **Problem**: Spark plan has daily write limits
- **Solution**: Run seeding during off-peak hours, or upgrade to Blaze plan

### Issue 2: Large JSON Load
- **Problem**: 20MB+ JSON file loaded in browser
- **Solution**: Already handled - fetched once, processed in batches

### Issue 3: Duplicate Tracks
- **Problem**: Re-running seed creates duplicates (auto-generated IDs)
- **Solution**: Only run once, or manually clear collection before re-seeding

## Next Steps
1. User navigates to Admin Dashboard
2. User clicks "Seed R2 Data" button
3. System uploads all tracks to Firestore
4. Tracks become visible in Music Pool for all users
5. Users can preview and download tracks
