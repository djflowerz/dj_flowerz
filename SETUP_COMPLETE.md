## 🛠️ Fixes Applied

We resolved several issues to get your app running:
1. **Fixed `index.html`**: Added missing entry point script (`/index.tsx`) that was causing a blank page.
2. **Fixed Dependencies**: Installed `react-is` (required by `recharts`) to fix build errors.
3. **Cleaned Install**: Removed old `node_modules` and re-installed cleanly with legacy peer deps.

### Firebase (Connected)

- **Storage**: Firebase Storage

### Paystack (Live Mode)
- **Public Key**: `pk_live_...05f71`
- **Callback**: `https://djflowerz-site.pages.dev/payment-success`

### Webhooks
